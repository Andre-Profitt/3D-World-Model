## Task: Implement Camera/Image Observations

**Milestone:** v0.4
**Section:** Visual Observations
**Estimated Time:** 4 hours
**Priority:** P0

### Specification
Add camera rendering to produce image observations from the 3D environment.

### Implementation Checklist

#### Code Changes
- [ ] `envs/simple_3d_nav.py`: Add `get_image_obs()` method
- [ ] Implement top-down camera view (64x64)
- [ ] Implement agent-centric camera view
- [ ] Add `OBS_TYPE` config option
- [ ] Support grayscale and RGB modes

#### Camera Implementation
- [ ] Use matplotlib for rendering (no external deps)
- [ ] Render agent as circle/square
- [ ] Render goal as star/target
- [ ] Show boundaries as lines
- [ ] Add optional trajectory trail

#### Config Updates
```python
OBS_CONFIG = {
    "type": "state" | "image" | "state+image",
    "image_size": (64, 64),
    "image_channels": 1 | 3,
    "camera_mode": "top_down" | "agent_centric"
}
```

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Environment can return image observations
- [ ] Images clearly show agent, goal, and boundaries
- [ ] Both camera modes work correctly
- [ ] No significant performance degradation
