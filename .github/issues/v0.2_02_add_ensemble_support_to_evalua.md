## Task: Add Ensemble Support to Model Evaluation

**Milestone:** v0.2
**Section:** Uncertainty & Evaluation
**Estimated Time:** 2 hours
**Priority:** P1

### Specification
Extend `scripts/eval_world_model_rollouts.py` to support ensemble models and uncertainty metrics.

### Implementation Checklist

#### Code Changes
- [ ] Load ensemble checkpoints when `use_ensemble=True`
- [ ] Compute prediction mean and variance across ensemble
- [ ] Add uncertainty correlation metrics
- [ ] Plot uncertainty vs actual error

#### Specific Work Items
- [ ] Modify model loading to handle multiple checkpoints
- [ ] Add `--use_ensemble` flag to evaluation script
- [ ] Compute epistemic uncertainty from ensemble variance
- [ ] Generate plots showing uncertainty bands
- [ ] Add correlation analysis between uncertainty and error

#### Tests
- [ ] Verify ensemble evaluation produces uncertainty metrics
- [ ] Check plots include confidence intervals
- [ ] Ensure single model mode still works

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Evaluation script works with both single and ensemble models
- [ ] Plots show prediction uncertainty bands
- [ ] Uncertainty correlates with actual errors (ρ > 0.5)
