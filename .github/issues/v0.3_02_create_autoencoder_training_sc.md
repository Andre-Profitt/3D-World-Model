## Task: Implement Autoencoder Training Pipeline

**Milestone:** v0.3
**Section:** Latent Representation
**Estimated Time:** 4 hours
**Priority:** P0
**Blocked By:** Encoder/Decoder implementation

### Specification
Create training script for observation autoencoder with proper evaluation.

### Implementation Checklist

#### Code Changes
- [ ] Create `training/train_autoencoder.py`
- [ ] Load observations from replay buffer
- [ ] Implement reconstruction loss (MSE)
- [ ] Add train/val split (90/10)
- [ ] Implement early stopping
- [ ] Save encoder.pt and decoder.pt separately

#### Training Features
- [ ] Learning rate scheduling
- [ ] Gradient clipping
- [ ] TensorBoard logging
- [ ] Checkpoint best model based on val loss

#### Evaluation Metrics
- [ ] Track reconstruction MSE
- [ ] Log example reconstructions
- [ ] Compute latent space statistics

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Training converges to <0.01 reconstruction error
- [ ] Validation loss stops improving (early stopping works)
- [ ] Saved models can be loaded and used
- [ ] Training completes in <10 minutes for 1M observations
